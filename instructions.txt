Instructions - Selva Viswanath

I have tested everything in Postman and the functions assigned are working fine.

Using body with json content-type for simplicity instead of headers.

Written a python script to populate data with 100 users and 8 contacts each. (populate_data_script.py)

SETUP

    Python=3.12.0
    DB: 
        Postgres (psycopg2) change if you want to
    packages:
        Django=5.0.1
        djangorestframework
        psycopg2

    `pip install  Django=5.0.1 djangorestframework psycopg2`

Step 1:  Create an user with password
    POST to url: HOST/users

    Example: MANDATORY FIELDS
    {
        "username": "any name",
        "phone_number": "ur number",
        "password": "desired password"
    }
    Response will be 201 Created.


    NOTE: 
        ** username, phone and password are mandatory.
        ** password should have atleast 1 lowercase, 1 uppercase, 1 number, 1 symbol[@, #, %, $], and should be atleast 8 and lesser than 18 characters long.







=====
AUTHENTICATION must
NO PUBLIC ACCESS

**You need to be authenticated to perform any actions below

Must provide id as request parameter like "users/3"

Must provide password in every request following
example:
    {
        "password":"efADA#$d11",
        .........
    }
=====

Step 2:  Create contacts

    POST - url: HOST/users/{id}/addContacts

    Example: **password is MANDATORY
             **contacts must be a list
    {
        "password": "your password for the appropriate id",
        "contacts": [
            {"name": "Contact1", "phone_number": "1111111111"},
            {"name": "Contact2", "phone_number": "2222222222"},
            {"name": "Contact3", "phone_number": "3333333333"}
        ]
    }

    Note: these will be automatically inserted into GlobalContact Table As well. (skips if already exists)



-----
Step 3: List the particular user's contacts

    GET - url: HOST/users/{id}/list_my_contacts
    
    {
        "password":"ur password",
    }

    Note:  You will only receive the contacts of that particular user,
    Will not be listed if not authenticated.


-----
Step 4: Mark a contact as spam

    POST - url : HOST/users/{id}/mark_contact_as_spam

    {
        "phone_number" : "967678",
        "password":"ur password"
    }

    Note:
        *that number will be marked as spam and its "spam_points" will be incremented by 1 in the GlobalContact.spam_points column.
        *If already marked as spam by the user, nothing will happen.




-----
Step 5: Get Contacts from Global database

    GET - url : HOST/users/{id}/global-contacts

    {
        "password":"your password"
    }

    Response: 200
        List of all available contacts in the global database with their spam_points

Step 6: Search by Name in the Global database (using Query parmameters)

    
    GET - url: 
            HOST/users/{id}/global-contacts/search-name{?name=vishwa}   <-- pass the name here as query parameter

    {
        "password":"your password"
    }


-----
Step 7: Search by Phone Number in the Global database (using Query parmameters)

    
    GET - url: 
            HOST/users/{id}/global-contacts/search-phone-number{?phone_number=4434231215}   <-- pass the number here as query parameter

    {
        "password":"your password"
    }
